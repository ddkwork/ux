## Added Go 1.24 support

This release adds support for Go 1.24.

## Checks

### Changed checks

The following checks have been improved:

- {{< check "U1000" >}} treats all fields in a struct as used if the struct has
  a field of type `structs.HostLayout`.
- {{< check "S1009" >}} now emits a clearer message.
- {{< check "S1008" >}} no longer recommends simplifying branches that contain
  comments ({{< issue "704" >}}, {{< issue "1488" >}}).
- {{< check "S1009" >}} now flags another redundant nil check ({{< issue "1605" >}}).
- {{< check "QF1002" >}} now emits a valid automatic fix for switches that use
  initialization statements ({{< issue "1613" >}}).
